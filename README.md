# Impact of Internet Access on Final Grade

A study of how home internet access impacts a student's final grade. 

Created as the final project of [STAT 201: Statistical Inference for Data Science](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=STAT&course=201). To view this project's proposal, navigate to `src/proposal.ipynb`. To view the final report, go to `src/final_report.ipynb`. 



## Technologies
The analysis and report was made in Jupyter notebooks, using R with the Tidyverse and Infer packages.

## Setup
Clone this repository. 

If needed, install Jupyter and R on your local machine, and set up the Jupyter kernel to run R code. 

Open up the final report (`src/final_report.ipynb`), install the necessary packages, then run all the cells. Enjoy!
